# hyppo v0.1.0

hyppo 0.1.0 is the culmination of 8 months of hard work. It contains many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better documentation. All users are encouraged to use this release instead of the mgcpy, which this package is replacing, are a large number of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on this branch, and on adding new features on the development master branch.

Release highlights (as compared to mgcpy):

* New time series and discriminability modules
* More user-friendly implementation of *k*-Sample Testing

This release requires Python 3.5+.

## New features

### Independence testing

Tests have been given a unique class as compared to mgcpy. Parallelization in this module makes tests faster and ``Hsic`` has been added as a standalone test within this package (uses exact equivalence implementation).

### *k*-sample testing

*k*-Sample testing is now organized within a class that is modeled similarly to how independence tests are run. More information about the specifics of how this works can be found in the docs.

### Time series

Time series based independence tests have been included as a separate module from independence tests.

### Simulations

Simulations have been included as a separate module and ``hyppo.sims`` now includes k-sample simulations and time series simulations.

### Discriminability

Discriminability has been included from the r-mgc package and has been changed so it conforms to the ``hyppo`` API.

### Benchmarks

A benchmarks folder as been added that contains notebooks comparing statistical power, algorithm wall times, and test statistics comparisons between the algorithms and sometimes between the respective R implementations. Many of those notebooks have been condensed into tutorials in the documentation.

## Other changes

API has been changed as compared to mgcpy and is modeled after scikit-learn with the inclusion of the ``base.py`` containing an abstract class within each module and energy with a ``.test`` method calculating test statistic in p-value.
