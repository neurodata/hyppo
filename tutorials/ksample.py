`K`-Sample Testing
*********************

A common problem experienced in research is the `k`-sample testing problem.
Conceptually, it can be described as follows: consider `k` groups of data where each
group had a different treatment. We can ask, are these groups the similar to one
another or statistically different? More specifically, supposing that each group has
a distribution, are these distributions equivalent to one another, or is one of them
different?

If you are interested in questions of this mold, this module of the package is for you!
All our tests can be found in :mod:`hyppo.ksample`, and will be elaborated in
detail below. But before that, let's look at the mathematical formulations:

Consider random variables :math:`U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_k` with distributions
:math:`F_{U_1}, F_{U_2}, \ldots F_{U_k}`.
When performing `k`-sample testing, we are seeing whether or not
these distributions are equivalent. That is, we are testing

.. math::

    H_0 &: F_{U_1} = F_{U_2} = \cdots = F_{U_k} \\
    H_A &: \exists \, i \neq j \text{ s.t. } F_{U_i} \neq F_{U_j}

Like all the other tests within hyppo, each method has a :func:`statistic` and
:func:`test` method. The :func:`test` method is the one that returns the test statistic
and p-values, among other outputs, and is the one that is used most often in the
examples, tutorials, etc.
The p-value returned is calculated using a permutation test using
:meth:`hyppo.tools.perm_test` unless otherwise specified.

Specifics about how the test statistics are calculated for each in
:class:`hyppo.ksample` can be found the docstring of the respective test.
let's look at unique properties of some of these tests:

########################################################################################
# Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Hotelling
# ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# **MANOVA** is the current standard for `k`-sample testing in the literature.
# More details can be found in :class:`hyppo.ksample.MANOVA`.
# **Hotelling** is 2-sample MANOVA.
# More details can be found in :class:`hyppo.ksample.Hotelling`.
#
# .. note::
#
#    :Pros: - Very fast
#           - Similar to tests found in scientific literature
#    :Cons: - Not accurate when compared to other tests in most situations
#           - Assumes data is derived from a multivariate Gaussian
#           - Assumes data is has same covariance matrix
#
# Neither of these test are distance based, and so do not have a ``compute_distance``
# parameter and are not nonparametric, so they don't have ``reps`` nor ``workers``.
# Otherwise, these test runs like :ref:`any other test<general indep>`.

# `K`-Sample Testing via Independence Testing
# ---------------------------------------------
#
# **Nonparametric MANOVA via Independence Testing** is a `k`-sample test that addresses
# the aforementioned `k`-sample testing problem as follow: reduce the `k`-sample testing
# problem to the independence testing problem (see :ref:`indep`).
# To solve this, we create a new matrix of concatenated inputs and a matrix that labels
# which of the concatenated data comes from which input `[2]`_.
# Because independence tests have high finite sample testing power in some cases, this
# method has a number of advantages.
# More details can be found in :class:`hyppo.ksample.KSample`.
# The following applies to both:
#
# .. note::
#
#    If you want use 2-sample MGC, we have added that functionality to SciPy!
#    Please see :func:`scipy.stats.multiscale_graphcorr`.
#
# .. note::
#
#    :Pros: - Highly accurate
#           - No additional computation complexity added
#           - Not many assumptions of the data (only must be i.i.d.)
#           - Has fast implementations (for ``indep_test="Dcorr"`` and
#             ``indep_test="Hsic"``)
#    :Cons: - Can be a little slower than some of the other tests in the package
#
# The ``indep_test`` parameter accepts a string corresponding to the name of the class
# in the :mod:`hyppo.independence`.
# Other parameters are those in the corresponding independence test.
# Since this this process is nearly the same for all independence tests, we are going
# to use :class:`hyppo.independence.MGC` as the example independence test.

from hyppo.ksample import KSample
from hyppo.tools import rot_ksamp

# 100 samples, 1D cubic independence simulation, 3 groups sim, 60 degree rotation, no
# noise
sims = rot_ksamp("linear", n=100, p=1, k=3, degree=[60, -60], noise=True)

########################################################################################
# The data are points simulating a 1D linear relationship between random variables
# :math:`X` and :math:`Y`. It the concatenates these two matrices, and then rotates
# the simulation by 60 degrees, generating the second and, in this case, the third
# sample. It returns realizations as :class:`numpy.ndarray`.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# make plots look pretty
sns.set(color_codes=True, style="white", context="talk", font_scale=1)

# look at the simulation
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
for sim in sims:
    plt.scatter(sim[:, 0], sim[:, 1])
plt.xticks([])
plt.yticks([])
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True, right=True)
plt.show()

# run k-sample test on the provided simulations. Note that *sims just unpacks the list
# we got containing our simulated data
stat, pvalue = KSample(indep_test="Dcorr").test(*sims)
print(stat, pvalue)

########################################################################################
# This was a general use case for the test, but there are a number of intricacies that
# depend on the type of independence test chosen. Those same parameters can be modified
# in this class. For a full list of the parameters, see the desired test in
# :mod:`hyppo.independence` and for examples on how to use it, see :ref:`indep`.

########################################################################################
# Distance (and Kernel) Equivalencies
# --------------------------------------------
#
# It turns out that a number of test statistics are multiples of one another and so,
# their p-values are equivalent to the above :ref:`nonpar manova`. `[1]`_ goes through
# the distance and kernel equivalencies and `[2]`_ goes through the independence and
# two-sample (and by extension `k`-sample) equivalences in far more detail.
#
# **Energy** is a powerful distance-based two sample test,
# **Distance components (DISCO)** is the `k`-sample analogue to Energy,
# and **Maximal mean discrepency (MMD)** is a powerful kernel-based two sample test,
# These are equivalent to :class:`hyppo.ksample.KSample` using ``indep_test="Dcorr"``
# for Energy and DISCO and ``indep_test="Hsic"`` for MMD.
# More information can be found at :class:`hyppo.ksample.Energy`,
# :class:`hyppo.ksample.DISCO`, and
# :class:`hyppo.ksample.MMD`.
# However, the test statistics have been modified to make it more in tune with other
# implementations.
#
# .. note::
#
#    :Pros: - Highly accurate
#           - Has similar test statistics to the literature
#           - Has fast implementations
#    :Cons: - Lower power than more computationally complex algorithms
#
# For MMD, kernels are used instead of distances with the ``compute_kernel`` parameter.
# Any addition, if the bias variant of the test statistic is required, then the ``bias``
# parameter can be set to ``True``. In general, we do not recommend doing this.
# Otherwise, these tests runs like :ref:`any other test<general indep>`.

########################################################################################
# Smooth Characteristic Function Test
# --------------------------------------------
#
# The **Smooth Characteristic Function Test** (Smooth CF), is a form of non-parametric two-sample
# tests. The Smooth CF test utilizes smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent
# two data distributions. Characteristic functions completely define the probability distribution
# of a random variable. In hypothesis testing, it is useful to estimate characteristic functions
# for given data. However, empirical characteristic functions can be very complex and therefore
# expensive to compute. The smooth characteristic function can serve as a heuristic in place of
# the empirical function which is much faster w.r.t. computation times. More information can be
# found at :class:`hyppo.ksample.SmoothCFTest`.
#
# .. note::
#
#    :Pros: - Very fast computation time
#           - Faster than current, state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based tests
#    :Cons: - Heuristic method, checking more frequencies will give more power.
#
# This test is also initialized with the ``num_randfreq`` parameter. This parameter can be
# thought of as the degrees of freedom associated with the test and also dictates the number
# of test points used in the test (see :class:`hyppo.ksample.SmoothCFTest`). If data
# is kept constant, increasing the magnitude of this parameter will generally result in
# larger magnitude test statistics while magnitude of the p-value will fluctuate:

import numpy as np
from hyppo.ksample import SmoothCFTest

np.random.seed(1234)
x = np.random.randn(500, 10)
y = np.random.randn(500, 10)

stat1, pvalue1 = SmoothCFTest(num_randfreq=5).test(x, y, random_state=1234)
stat2, pvalue2 = SmoothCFTest(num_randfreq=10).test(x, y, random_state=1234)

print("5 degrees of freedom (stat, pval):\n", stat1, pvalue1)
print("10 degrees of freedom (stat, pval):\n", stat2, pvalue2)

########################################################################################
# Mean Embedding Test
# --------------------------------------------
#
# The **Mean Embedding Test** is another non-parametric two-sample statistical test. This test
# is based on analytic mean embeddings of data distributions in a reproducing kernel hilbert
# space (RKHS). Hilbert spaces allow the representation of functions as points; thus, if
# mean embeddings can be determined for two data distributions then the distance between
# these two distributions in the hilbert space can be determined. In other words, the RKHS
# allows the mapping of probability measures into a finite dimensional Euclidean space. More
# details can be found at :class:`hyppo.ksample.MeanEmbeddingTest`.
#
# .. note::
#
#    :Pros: - Very fast computation time
#           - Faster than current, state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based tests
#    :Cons: - Heuristic method, checking more frequencies will give more power.
#
# This test is also initialized with the ``num_randfreq`` parameter. This parameter can be
# thought ofas the degrees of freedom associated with the test and also dictates the number
# of test points used in the test (see :class:`hyppo.ksample.MeanEmbeddingTest`). If data
# is kept constant, increasing the magnitude of this parameter will generally result in
# larger magnitude test statistics while magnitude of the p-value will fluctuate:

from hyppo.ksample import MeanEmbeddingTest

np.random.seed(1234)
x = np.random.randn(500, 10)
y = np.random.randn(500, 10)

stat1, pval1 = MeanEmbeddingTest(num_randfreq=5).test(x, y, random_state=1234)
stat2, pval2 = MeanEmbeddingTest(num_randfreq=10).test(x, y, random_state=1234)

print("5 degrees of freedom (stat, pval):\n", stat1, pval1)
print("10 degrees of freedom (stat, pval):\n", stat2, pval2)
