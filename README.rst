hyppo (\ **HYP**\ othesis Testing in **P**\ yth\ **O**\ n, pronounced "Hippo") is an open-source software package for multivariate hypothesis testing. We decided to develop hyppo for the following reasons:

* With the increase in the amount of data in many fields, hypothesis testing for high dimensional and nonlinear data is important
* Libraries in R exist, but their interfaces are inconsistent and most are not available in Python

hyppo intends to be a comprehensive multivariate hypothesis testing package and runs on all major versions of operating systems. It also includes novel tests not found in other packages. It is quick to install and free of charge. If you need to use multivariate hypothesis testing, be sure to give hyppo a try!
